"""
Check that the user-facing docs still describe the CLI the code actually exposes.

Docs rot in two directions, and both are caught here by walking the live cyclopts app instead of a
hand-maintained list:

* A new flag or command ships without a mention anywhere (silently undocumented).
* A flag is renamed or dropped while the docs keep advertising the old name (silently wrong).

Run it with ``uv run scripts/check_docs_sync.py``; it needs the project environment because it
imports the app. Exits 0 when the docs agree with the CLI, 1 otherwise.
