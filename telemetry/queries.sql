-- Starter queries for the photo-tagger telemetry dataset.
--
-- Run these against the Cloudflare Analytics Engine SQL API (or paste into the dashboard's SQL
-- console). AE speaks a subset of the ClickHouse SQL dialect; the schema-v1-era statements here
-- were verified against the live dataset, and the schema-v2 additions follow the same verified
-- constructs (SUM/quantileWeighted/COUNT DISTINCT/toStartOfInterval and plain WHERE filters).
--
-- Every count is SUM(_sample_interval) rather than COUNT(): once volume is high enough that AE
-- starts sampling, _sample_interval is the per-row weight (it is 1 while no sampling happens), so
-- weighting keeps the totals honest. The same reason is why the medians use quantileWeighted.
--
-- Column map (see worker.js). One dataset holds two event kinds, discriminated by blob12:
-- 'run' rows (one per tagging run) and 'crash' rows (one per unhandled exception). Rows written
-- by schema-v1 clients predate blob12 and have '' there (and empty/zero v2 columns), so:
--   run rows   -> WHERE blob12 != 'crash'
--   crash rows -> WHERE blob12 = 'crash'
--   v2-only metrics (outcome counters, hardware) -> add AND double1 >= 2

-- 1. Most-used models (histogram), last 30 days.
SELECT blob4 AS model, SUM(_sample_interval) AS runs
FROM photo_tagger_telemetry
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '30' DAY AND blob12 != 'crash'
GROUP BY model
ORDER BY runs DESC;


-- 2. Typical batch size: the median number of photos per run.
SELECT quantileWeighted(0.5)(double2, _sample_interval) AS median_batch_size
FROM photo_tagger_telemetry
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '30' DAY AND blob12 != 'crash';


-- 3. CLI vs GUI split.
SELECT blob2 AS interface, SUM(_sample_interval) AS runs
FROM photo_tagger_telemetry
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '30' DAY AND blob12 != 'crash'
GROUP BY interface
ORDER BY runs DESC;


-- 4. Performance by CPU model: median run duration per chip.
-- Restricted to interface='cli' because a CLI run's duration is the batch's wall time, while a GUI
-- session's duration includes idle review time and is not comparable.
SELECT
  blob13 AS cpu,
  quantileWeighted(0.5)(double3, _sample_interval) AS median_seconds,

-- 5. OS distribution.
SELECT blob6 AS os, SUM(_sample_interval) AS runs
FROM photo_tagger_telemetry
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '30' DAY AND blob12 != 'crash'
GROUP BY os
ORDER BY runs DESC;


-- 6a. Active installs (distinct install ids) over the last 30 days.
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT index1) AS active_installs

GROUP BY day

-- 7. File-type combinations per run. blob11 is the sorted set of extensions in one batch (e.g.
-- "cr3,jpg"), so this groups by the whole combination. AE SQL has no splitByChar to explode it into
-- one row per format; the dashboard does that split client-side. This still shows RAW vs JPEG usage.

ORDER BY runs DESC;


-- 11. RAM distribution (schema v2). memory_gb is already a whole number of gigabytes, so raw
-- grouping clusters naturally (8, 16, 18, 24, 32, 36, 64, ...).
SELECT double12 AS memory_gb, SUM(_sample_interval) AS runs
FROM photo_tagger_telemetry

-- 12. Success and cache-hit rates (schema v2, real writes only: dry runs excluded). Divide
-- client-side: ok / (ok + failed), and cache_hits / photos.

WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '30' DAY AND blob12 = 'crash';

-- 14b. Top crash signatures: what breaks, and where in the code.
SELECT
  blob15 AS exception_type,
  blob16 AS crash_location,
  blob1 AS app_version,
  SUM(_sample_interval) AS crashes,
  COUNT(DISTINCT index1) AS installs
FROM photo_tagger_telemetry
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '30' DAY AND blob12 = 'crash'
GROUP BY exception_type, crash_location, app_version
ORDER BY crashes DESC;

-- 14c. Crashes per day, for a trend line.
SELECT
  toStartOfInterval(timestamp, INTERVAL '1' DAY) AS day,
  SUM(_sample_interval) AS crashes
FROM photo_tagger_telemetry
