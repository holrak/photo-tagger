Photo Tagger: CLI app to describe photos and add keywords using AI.

Optionally non-destructive: create/update XMP sidecar files with Lightroom-compatible tags.
Alternatively, pass --embed-in-photo to write metadata directly into the original file.
Unfortunately, Lightroom uses XMP sidecar files only for proprietary raw formats (e.g., CR3, NEF).
For JPEG, DNG and other formats, you'll often prefer embedding the metadata directly into the file.
This can be done with ExifTool manually as well:
    exiftool -tagsFromFile image.xmp -all:all image.jpg

Requirements:
 - Exiftool installed and available in PATH.
 - Ollama or LM Studio server running and containing a vision-language model.

    Tag images with AI and write Lightroom-compatible metadata (sidecar or embedded).

    Requirements:
    - ExifTool installed and on PATH.
    - Vision-language model API reachable (e.g., Ollama server).

    Inputs:
    - One or more --input/-i paths (files and/or directories; repeatable).
    - Files are processed as is. Directories use --ext (add --recursive for subfolders).
    - You can mix files and directories; order is preserved, duplicates skipped.

    Behavior:
    - Loads image (RAW supported), converts to in-memory JPEG, queries the model.
    - Generates title, description, and keywords; merges with existing XMP by default
        (use --overwrite-keywords to replace).
    - Writes metadata to an XMP sidecar (default) or embeds it directly when --embed-in-photo
        is used. Use --no-write-title/--no-write-description to skip fields; --no-backup-xmp
        to avoid backups.

    Skipping:
    - --skip-from FILE: skip files listed in FILE (one name or path per line).
    - --append-to-skip-file FILE: append each successfully processed file's path to FILE so a
        later run with --skip-from FILE resumes where this one stopped.
    - --skip-tagged: skip files that already have keywords, a description, or a title in
        the image or its XMP sidecar.

    Dry runs:
    - --dry-run: query the model and log the generated title, description, and keywords
        for each image but do not write any metadata. Useful for prompt iteration.

    Performance:
    - --workers N: process N photos concurrently using a thread pool. Each worker opens
        its own ExifToolHelper. The model server is the dominant bottleneck.
    - --max-keywords N: cap the number of AI-generated keywords kept before merging.

    Customization:
    - --prompt-file PATH: replace the default user prompt with the file's contents.
        Existing photo metadata (keywords, GPS, location) is still appended automatically.

    Exit status: returns 1 if no inputs are given, discovery finds no matching images, or any
        file fails. Returns 0 if discovery finds images but every one of them is subsequently
        excluded by --skip-from, --skip-tagged, or the date filters: that is "nothing left to
        do", not an error, and scripted incremental reruns rely on it not failing the batch.

    Examples:
        photo-tagger -i ./photos/IMG_0001.CR3

        photo-tagger \
            --extensions cr3,jpg \
            --provider lmstudio \

    Watch folders and tag photos as they arrive, until you stop it with Ctrl-C.

    This is the import-time workflow: point it at the folder your card reader, tethered capture, or
    sync client fills, and leave it running. Photos already in the folder are tagged first, then
    each new one as it lands.

    A file is only tagged once it has stopped changing (see ``--settle``), so a photo still being
    copied is left alone until the copy finishes. Scanning is a plain directory listing every
    ``--interval`` seconds, which behaves the same on every platform and over network shares.

    Every flag ``photo-tagger`` itself takes works here too and applies to each batch, with one
    agent, cache, and report file shared by the whole session. Each batch records its own undo
    journal, so ``photo-tagger undo`` puts back the last import rather than every import since the
    watch started. A batch where some photo fails is logged and the watch continues; the failure
    does not stop the loop.

    Examples:
        photo-tagger watch -i ~/Pictures/Inbox

        photo-tagger watch -i ~/Pictures/Inbox -r --interval 10 --skip-tagged
