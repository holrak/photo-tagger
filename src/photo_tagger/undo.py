"""
Record what a run wrote, so it can be put back.

A single bad prompt across five hundred photos used to be unwound by hand: ExifTool leaves
``*_original`` backups and photo-tagger creates sidecars, but nothing tied them to a run or knew
which sidecars existed beforehand. This module keeps that record.

Every write appends one line to a JSON-lines journal under the state directory (see
:func:`photo_tagger.config.state_dir`). ``photo-tagger undo`` reads the newest journal back and, for
each entry, either restores the ExifTool backup over the file or deletes the sidecar the run
created. Recording is on by default precisely because the runs people want to undo are the ones they
did not plan to.

Safety comes from the recorded size and mtime: an entry whose file has changed since the run is
refused rather than reverted, because that change is the user's later edit, not ours.
