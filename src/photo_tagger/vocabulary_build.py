"""
Build a controlled vocabulary out of the keywords a library already uses.

``--vocabulary-strict`` is the flag that stops a catalog sprawling, and it is unusable without a
good keyword file to point it at. Hand-writing one is not realistic, and exporting the whole catalog
does not help either: a catalog that has been tagged by a tool rather than by hand runs to tens of
thousands of keywords, most of them used once, which locks the sprawl in place instead of ending it.

So the file is derived from the library itself, in two steps:

* :func:`census_from_photos` counts what the photos actually carry, read through exiftool. This is
  the source that works everywhere, because it asks the photos rather than the application: digiKam,
  darktable, Immich, PhotoPrism, Synology Photos and the rest all write XMP/IPTC keywords, and only
  Lightroom offers a keyword-list export at all. It is also the more truthful count, one per photo,
  and ``XMP-lr:HierarchicalSubject`` carries the hierarchy those photos really use.
* :func:`census_from_export` reads a Lightroom keyword export instead, for a catalog that is not on
  this machine. Its counts are occurrences in the keyword *tree*, not photos, so a term filed under
  forty parents scores forty. Treat it as the proxy it is.

:func:`trim` then applies deterministic rules only: how often a term is used, how long it is,
whether it looks like a measurement rather than a subject, and which of several spellings of one
concept wins. Nothing here asks a model. Judgment calls that rules genuinely cannot make (which
terms are synonyms of each other, what a sane hierarchy would be) are a separate, opt-in pass.

Nothing in this module writes to a photo or to a catalog. It reads, counts, and renders a file for
the user to review and edit.
