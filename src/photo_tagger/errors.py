Domain exceptions raised by library modules.

These replace ``SystemExit`` in non-CLI code so that callers (tests, future library consumers) can
handle failures without catching ``SystemExit``. The CLI boundary in ``main.py`` translates them
into exit codes.

    Settings has to preserve everything it does not manage, and it cannot do that with a file it
    could not parse. Raised so the window reports the problem and leaves the file alone.
