"""
The optional model pass over a trimmed keyword list: synonyms and a hierarchy.

:mod:`photo_tagger.vocabulary_build` decides which keywords survive, and counting settles that
better than a model could. What counting cannot settle is meaning. Two questions are left over:

* Are "Golden Light" and "Golden Hour" one keyword or two? Loose matching folds case, punctuation,
  and plurals, so it already unifies "Animal" and "Animals". It cannot know that "Sea Hawk" is an
  osprey.
* Where does a keyword belong? A hierarchy has to come from somewhere, and a catalog a tool has
  been writing to is not a trustworthy source: derived from one, "Beach" ends up under "Sand".

The second question is why the model is asked for a *parent* as well as a category, and that field
earns its place: without it, asked only for synonyms, a model folds "Battery Pack" into "Camera
Accessories" and "Black" into "Color", destroying the narrower keyword. Naming the relation it
actually sees is what stops it reaching for the wrong one. Saying so in the prompt did not.

Both are judgment, so both are asked of the model, and only these two. Nothing here decides whether
a keyword is kept: that has already happened, deterministically, before this module runs.

Three things keep an opt-in model pass from making the file worse:

* **No invented keywords.** Every term the model returns is matched back to a term that was sent;
  anything else is dropped with a warning. The model regroups the list, it does not write it.
* **Nothing is lost.** A term folded into another is written as a ``{synonym}`` rather than deleted,
  so a photo tagged with it still matches.
* **A failed chunk changes nothing.** Terms in a chunk that errors, or that the model omits, keep
  the shape the deterministic pass gave them.

Categories are chosen once, up front, and every chunk assigns against that one fixed list. Asking
each chunk to invent its own would give "Animal" in one and "Animals" in the next, which is exactly
the sprawl this command exists to end.
