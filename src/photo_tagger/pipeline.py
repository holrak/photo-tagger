    Run the initial pass plus a single retry pass and return summary totals.

    When workers == 1 a single ExifToolHelper is opened for the whole batch so every metadata read
    and write reuses one long-running exiftool subprocess. When workers > 1 the tasks run on a
    ThreadPoolExecutor and each task opens its own short-lived helper (pyexiftool's -stay_open pipe
    is not safe to share across threads).

    The optional *on_success* callback fires once per image that completes successfully (whether on
    the first pass or after a retry). It receives the image path. The CLI uses this to append
    filenames to a skip list as work progresses, so a killed run can be resumed without redoing
    finished photos. Dry runs never fire it: nothing was written, so nothing may be recorded as
    done.

    The optional *progress* callback fires exactly once per image when the pipeline is finally done
    with it: either on first-pass success, or on retry-pass success or failure. First-pass failures
    are silent because they're still pending retry; this guarantees the bar reaches 100% without
    overshooting on flaky files.

    With a *session_plan*, the batch is processed one shoot at a time: every photo in a session is
    analyzed first, the session's keywords are harmonized (see :mod:`photo_tagger.sessions`), and
    only then is anything written. Progress and the *on_success* callback still fire once per photo,
    the latter after its write rather than after its analysis.
