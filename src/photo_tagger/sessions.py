"""
Group a batch into shoots and make each shoot's keywords agree with itself.

Every photo is analyzed on its own, so forty frames of the same bird can come back as "Osprey" here
and "Ospreys" there, under "Bird<Animal" on one frame and "Raptor<Wildlife" on the next. Lightroom
then shows four keywords where there is one subject.

The fix has two halves. :func:`plan_sessions` splits the batch where the capture time jumps by more
than the configured gap, which is what a "shoot" actually is. :func:`build_session_vocabulary` then
turns everything the model said about one session into a :class:`~photo_tagger.vocabulary.
Vocabulary`, letting the majority spelling and the majority hierarchy win, and the pipeline snaps
every photo in the session onto it before writing.

Deriving the vocabulary from the batch's own output (rather than nudging the model with a prompt) is
what makes this deterministic: the result does not depend on which photo happened to finish first.
