"""
Controlled vocabulary: the fixed term list generated keywords are snapped onto.

A photographer who already curates a Lightroom keyword hierarchy does not want an AI seeding it with
near-duplicates ("Osprey" next to "Sea Hawk", "Bird of Prey" next to "Raptor"). A vocabulary names
the terms that are allowed: every generated keyword is matched against it and either rewritten to
the catalog's own spelling or, in strict mode, dropped.

Two things build a :class:`Vocabulary`: :func:`load_vocabulary` reads the user's keyword file, and
:mod:`photo_tagger.sessions` derives one from a shoot's own output so photos of the same subject
agree with each other. Both then run through the same matcher.

Matching is deliberately layered, cheapest first: exact (case-insensitive), then a loose key that
ignores punctuation and spacing, then a bounded fuzzy pass for typos and small variants. Only the
first two tiers are language-specific, and only in one place: folding an English plural onto its
singular. That folding is applied for English output and skipped for every other language, because
its rules are wrong elsewhere (German "Alles" would collapse onto "Alle") and useless in a script
they cannot even see (Russian "птицы"). Everything else here is language-neutral: case folding,
punctuation, and the fuzzy ratio work the same on any script.

Languages that inflect more than English get less unification for free, so the vocabulary file's
``{synonym}`` syntax is the reliable way to declare that "птицы" is "Птица".
