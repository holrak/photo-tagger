"""
Qt-free helpers and per-photo state for the desktop GUI.

Kept separate from :mod:`photo_tagger.gui` so the GUI's logic (expanding dropped paths, grouping
files for the tree, parsing the editable keyword field, building the keyword set to write) is plain
Python the test suite covers normally, with no display server and no dependency on the optional
PySide6 extra. ``gui.py`` is then just the widget and event-loop shell that wires these helpers to
Qt.
