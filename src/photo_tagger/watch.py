"""
Watch folders for new photos and hand each settled batch to the caller.

Tagging on import is the natural place for this tool in a photographer's workflow: point it at the
folder the card reader (or the tethered capture, or the sync client) fills, and let it work as the
files land. Everything the batch runner needs already exists; what was missing is the loop.

Polling, not filesystem events: a poll is a directory listing every few seconds, it behaves the same
on every platform and over network shares, and it needs no extra dependency. A file must also *hold
still* before it is tagged, since a photo half-copied onto the disk is not a photo yet.
