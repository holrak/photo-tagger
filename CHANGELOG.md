# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and this project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.8.0] - 2026-09-03

### Added

- `--vocabulary PATH`: keep generated keywords inside a controlled vocabulary, so a curated catalog
  stops collecting near-duplicates. Reads a Lightroom keyword export or a plain list. Matching
  ignores case, punctuation, and typos, and every match takes the file's own spelling and hierarchy.
- `--vocabulary-strict`: drop a keyword the vocabulary does not cover instead of writing it as it
  came.
- `--session-gap MINUTES`: group the batch into shoots by capture time and make each shoot agree
  with itself, so forty frames of one bird stop reaching the catalog as `Osprey`, `Ospreys`, and
  `Bird|Osprey`.
- `photo-tagger vocabulary`: build that vocabulary from the keywords your library already uses, read
  off the photos with ExifTool. `--organize` adds an opt-in model pass that folds synonyms and adds
  a hierarchy. Nothing is written to your photos.
- `photo-tagger undo`: put back what a run wrote, from the journal every run now records. On by
  default (`--no-undo-log`).
- `photo-tagger watch`: tag photos as they arrive, each one once it stops changing.
- GUI: all of the above, without a terminal. Keyword rules live in **Settings**, the three commands
  in **Tools**.
- GUI: **Back** and **Forward** over the photos and folder grids you have visited, as arrows above
  the pane and in a new **Go** menu. Opening a photo from a thumbnail grid used to be a one-way
  trip.

### Changed

- The HTTP dependency moved from `httpx` to `httpx2`.

### Fixed

- `--skip-tagged` and the GUI's **Tagged** column credit every photo that shares one XMP sidecar, so
  a RAW and JPEG pair no longer reads as half untagged.
- `>` separates a keyword hierarchy even when mixed with `<`.
- Keyword files, skip lists, and the prompt file are read as `utf-8-sig`, so a byte-order mark no
  longer corrupts the first line.
- `--append-to-skip-file` is safe when two runs share one file.
- A rejected credential (401 or 403) skips the retry pass instead of paying for a second round of
  failing requests.
- Tokens spent on failed calls are counted, so the summary no longer understates spend.
- Tagging a batch that turns out to be empty no longer truncates the previous `--csv-file` report.
- `--log-folder` is validated when the flags are parsed, and a logging failure exits cleanly.
- `photo-tagger doctor` reports its warning about a redirected ExifTool binary.
- The first run no longer stalls on exit while telemetry probes the hardware.
- GUI: removing a folder from a large list, quitting the window, and the first drag-and-drop no
  longer crash.
- GUI: closing with unsaved proposals asks first.
- GUI: the window no longer freezes on a folder that is still loading or a metadata scan of a large
  folder, **Cancel** during a save is honored, and **Clear List** is refused while a save runs.
- GUI: unchecking a subfolder repaints the folders above it.
- GUI: a single-photo **Save** reports an ExifTool error instead of dying silently.
- GUI: a per-photo **hint** no longer enters the shared cache.

### Security

- The LM Studio provider no longer falls back to `OPENAI_API_KEY`. It is the default provider, so a
  real OpenAI key went as a bearer token to whatever `--url` pointed at.
- The API key is redacted from provider error logs and messages.
- CSV report cells that start with `=`, `+`, `-`, or `@` are quoted, so a file name or a generated
  title cannot run as a spreadsheet formula (CWE-1236).
- Log files are created owner-only (mode 0600) on POSIX systems.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-08-08

### Added

- GUI: the bottom bar now shows the time **elapsed** and the estimated time **left** next to the
  progress bar, for both generating and saving (`2:30 elapsed · 8:10 left`).

- GUI: a **Keep ExifTool Backup** toggle in the Save options menu (the CLI's `--no-backup-xmp`).
  Saving used to always leave a `*_original` copy of every photo behind, which on a large batch
  doubles the disk space used. It defaults to on and persists via *Save Settings as Defaults*.

### Changed

- GUI: **Save Selected** now writes on a background thread (sharing one ExifTool process for the
  batch) instead of blocking the window. Saving a large batch used to freeze the interface behind
  the OS busy cursor with no sign of progress, which looked like a crash. It now reports per photo,
  and **Cancel** stops it after the file in flight.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added

- Anonymous crash reports: an unhandled exception sends the exception *type* and its code location
  inside photo-tagger (`module:function:line`), never the error message (messages can embed paths).
  Same opt-outs as the usage telemetry; capped per process. The one-time telemetry notice re-shows
  once for existing installs so the expanded disclosure is seen.
- Telemetry now reports coarse hardware facts (CPU/GPU model, logical cores, RAM in whole GB; probed
  once and cached), per-run outcome counters (successes, failures, cache hits, retry recoveries,
  workers, token totals, model time, dry-run flag), and failure buckets (fixed labels like `timeout`
  or `metadata-write`) so breakage is measurable, not anecdotal.
- The telemetry dashboard grew sections for adoption, usage, hardware & performance, and reliability
  & crashes, plus a global interface filter (all/CLI/GUI).
- The inference cache prunes entries older than 180 days when it opens, so `cache.sqlite` stops
  growing forever (every settings change orphans its old namespace).
- A short pause before the retry pass, so an overloaded model server is not immediately re-hit.

### Changed

- `--append-to-skip-file` records full paths instead of bare filenames, so duplicate camera names
  across folders (`A/IMG_0001.CR3`, `B/IMG_0001.CR3`) can no longer make a resumed run silently skip
  unprocessed photos. Old name-only skip files keep working.
- Config-file values now pass through the same conversion and validation as CLI flags, so a mistyped
  value fails with a clean error at startup instead of a traceback mid-run.
- Photos with identical pixel content in one concurrent run share a single model call instead of
  each paying their own.
- CSV reports are written as `utf-8-sig` so Excel renders accented titles and keywords correctly.

### Fixed

- Passing any CLI flag from an option group no longer silently resets the group's other config-file
  values to built-in defaults (e.g. `--temperature` used to revert a configured `max_tokens`).
- `--dry-run` no longer appends previewed photos to `--append-to-skip-file`, which made later real
  runs skip photos that never got metadata.
- The description mirror is written to `XMP-tiff:ImageDescription`; the previous `XMP-exif` tag was
  silently rejected by ExifTool, so the mirror never reached the file.
- Keyword capitalization no longer corrupts acronyms and apostrophes (`NYC` stays `NYC` instead of
  becoming `Nyc`; `bird's nest` no longer becomes `Bird'S Nest`).
- One corrupt or zero-byte photo no longer makes the whole folder read as untagged (and get
  re-tagged): the batched ExifTool reads salvage the healthy files, and `--skip-tagged` and the
  GUI's Tagged column now distinguish "could not read" from "no metadata".
- Windows: file locking works again (the PID note into the held lock file raised on every
  acquisition), and the batched metadata reads no longer miss every file over path-separator
  differences.
- Ctrl-C during concurrent batch start-up is honored instead of grinding through every queued photo;
  never-submitted photos are reported as pending.
- A single over-long or blank keyword from the model no longer burns the whole validation retry
  budget (full vision calls); items are cleaned instead.
- GUI: streamed-in thumbnails no longer swallow the next grid click; a non-domain error during
  generation no longer leaves the window stuck in the running state; removing photos prunes the
  visible grid and thumbnail cache; bulk actions no longer kick you out of the photo or folder being
  reviewed.
- The `gui` command only suggests installing the `[gui]` extra when PySide6/shiboken6 is actually
  missing; other import errors surface as themselves.
- A failed cache initialization no longer leaks its SQLite connection.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-09

### Added

- The GUI is translated at runtime (gettext) and ships a complete Brazilian Portuguese (`pt_BR`)
  translation. Pick a language with **Settings > Language**, the `language` config key, or
  `PHOTO_TAGGER_LANG`; the default follows the OS locale.
- New `llamacpp` provider for llama.cpp's `llama-server`. Default endpoint
  `http://localhost:8080/v1`; env vars `LLAMA_CPP_BASE_URL` and `LLAMA_CPP_API_KEY` (the key is only
  needed when `llama-server` was started with `--api-key`).
- Anonymous, opt-out usage telemetry with a one-time first-run notice. Disable it with
  `--no-telemetry`, `PHOTO_TAGGER_NO_TELEMETRY=1` (or `DO_NOT_TRACK=1`), `enabled = false` under
  `[telemetry]` in the config file, or the GUI's **Settings > Send Anonymous Telemetry** toggle.
- GUI redesign: split **Generate**/**Save** buttons with option menus, thumbnail badges,
  multi-selection with bulk actions, tree columns for file type, status, and already-tagged,
  collapsible keyword-change details, reveal-in-file-manager on Windows, Linux, and macOS, and CSV
  export.
- The GUI now caches results by default (sharing the CLI's cache format), with skip-cache actions
  for forcing a fresh generation.
- **Settings > Save Settings as Defaults** merges into the existing config file instead of rewriting
  it, preserving comments and unknown keys.
- Windowed `photo-tagger-gui` entry point, so the desktop app launches without a console window.
- `exiftool_path` config key and `PHOTO_TAGGER_EXIFTOOL` env var for ExifTool installs not on
  `PATH`. A GUI launched from Finder also inherits the login shell's `PATH` automatically.
- `packaging/build_macos_app.sh` builds a standalone, double-clickable macOS app with PyInstaller.

### Changed

- Console logging is capped at `INFO` from import (so nothing above it leaks before the CLI flags
  apply), and file logs are serialized as JSON lines.
- System prompt now demands English-only, single-script output and at most one hierarchy chain per
  keyword.

### Fixed

- The GUI's telemetry beacon is flushed before the process exits instead of being lost.
- The GUI result cache is keyed on the image content hash, so **Embed in Photo** no longer
  invalidates it.
- Hierarchical keywords written with `>` separators are parsed as hierarchies instead of being
  mangled, and model keywords are deduplicated.
- Ctrl-C during a concurrent batch no longer miscounts photos that finished while the pool drained.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-26

### Changed

- The `--cache-file` inference cache is now keyed on the image data only (ExifTool's
  `ImageDataHash`) instead of a hash of the whole file. Writing metadata into a photo no longer
  changes the key, so a rerun over the same folder hits the cache even after `--embed-in-photo`
  wrote tags on the first pass. Formats ExifTool cannot hash that way fall back to the whole-file
  hash. Existing cache files are simply repopulated on the next run.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added

- Optional desktop GUI (`photo-tagger gui`), via the `gui` extra
  (`pip install 'photo-tagger[gui]'`). A PySide6 review-before-write frontend: drag in photos or
  folders, generate proposals, then review and edit each photo's title, description, and keywords
  (with a live Lightroom-hierarchy preview) before saving. PySide6 is imported lazily, so the base
  CLI never depends on Qt.
- New `openai` provider for any hosted OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Set `OPENAI_BASE_URL` / `--url`
  and `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `--api-key`; fails fast when no key is configured.
- New `photo-tagger doctor` command: a pre-flight check that ExifTool is on PATH and the provider is
  reachable and serves the requested model, exiting non-zero on failure.
- `--csv-file PATH` on the `tag` command writes a per-photo CSV report (existing/written metadata,
  camera, location, GPS, usage, timing), alongside `--summary-file` and `--json`.
- `--write-keywords` / `--no-write-keywords` (default on) refreshes the title and description while
  leaving existing keywords on disk untouched.
- A PEP 561 `py.typed` marker so downstream projects can consume the package's type hints.

### Changed

- Backends now live in a `photo_tagger.providers` registry; adding a backend is a single entry.
- Existing keywords use a typed `KeywordSet` value object instead of a bare `dict[str, list[str]]`.
- The package version is read from installed distribution metadata, so `pyproject.toml` is the only
  code-side source of truth.
- CLI option groups moved out of `main.py` into `photo_tagger.cli_options`.

### Fixed

- Hierarchical keywords are generated reliably again: the model schema now has a dedicated
  `hierarchies` field for taxonomy chains (`Golden Eagle<Bird of Prey<Animal`) instead of expecting
  `<` embedded in the flat `keywords` list, which the model had stopped doing. (The CLI cache is
  keyed on the user prompt only, so delete a stale `--cache-file` to pick this up on
  already-processed photos; the GUI never caches.)

## [0.2.2] - 2026-05-30

### Added

- MIT License. The `LICENSE` file now ships in the sdist via PEP 639 `license-files`; the deprecated
  `License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License` classifier was dropped.

### Changed

- System prompt now forbids emitting the camera body, lens model, or capture timestamp as keywords;
  these describe equipment, not subject content. Earlier runs sometimes copied literal EXIF strings
  (e.g. `Canon Eos R5M2`, `Rf200-800Mm F6.3-9 Is Usm`) into the keyword list.

### Fixed

- `create_agent` no longer has a code path where the provider could be left unbound for a value
  outside the supported set. Provider construction moved into `_build_provider`, which returns from
  each branch and ends in `assert_never`, keeping the match exhaustive for the type checker.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-27

### Fixed

- `AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'parent'` when writing the summary file after a
  successful run if `summary_file` (or any other `Path` field) was set via the TOML config rather
  than the CLI. `apply_overrides` now coerces string TOML values to `Path` for fields annotated as
  `Path` or `Path | None`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-26

### Added

- TOML config file. Search order: `$PHOTO_TAGGER_CONFIG`, `./.photo-tagger.toml`,
  `~/.config/photo-tagger/config.toml`. CLI flags still win. See
  [`.photo-tagger.example.toml`](.photo-tagger.example.toml) for a template.
- `--workers N` for thread-pool concurrency (default 1; the model server is usually the bottleneck).
- `--cache-file PATH` SQLite cache of model outputs keyed by image content hash plus model, prompt,
  and sampling settings. Reruns skip the model entirely when nothing relevant changed. WAL mode is
  enabled.
- `--lock-file PATH` exclusive file lock that refuses to start if another `photo-tagger` already
  holds it. Cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows).
- `--summary-file PATH` writes a JSON run summary on completion (success counts, failed files, token
  usage, wall time). Atomic write; parent dir is created.
- `--json` emits one NDJSON line per processed photo on stdout. Logs and progress stay on stderr so
  `| jq` works.
- `--skip-tagged` skips files whose image or sidecar already has keywords, description, or title
  (catches photos tagged in Lightroom or by hand).
- `--append-to-skip-file PATH` records each successful filename so a later run with
  `--skip-from PATH` resumes where this one stopped.
- `--newer-than` / `--older-than` ISO 8601 mtime filters. Naive timestamps are read as local time.
- `--prompt-file PATH` replaces the default user prompt with file contents; existing photo metadata
  is still appended.
- `--max-keywords N` caps the AI keyword count per photo before merging with existing tags.
- `--dry-run` runs the model and logs the proposed metadata without writing.
- `--timeout-seconds` per-image hard cap; the retry loop handles the abort.
- `--frequency-penalty` (default 0.5) suppresses chant-style token loops observed with Qwen3-VL at
  low temperature.
- `--progress` / `--no-progress` rich progress bar (auto-disabled on non-tty stderr).
- Graceful Ctrl-C in batch runs.
- Token usage tracking per call (`InferenceResult`) and per batch (`BatchTotals`).

### Changed

- System prompt rewritten: anchors on visible image content, treats EXIF/GPS as corroborative
  evidence only, refuses to copy existing keywords as filler.
- Default console log level is now `INFO` (was `DEBUG`).
- Default `MAX_TOKENS` raised to 1200.
- Progress bar routed to stderr; stays clean alongside `--json`.
- Existing keywords are de-duplicated case-insensitively at read time.
- `WeightedFlatSubject` is now written back when persisting merged keywords.
- `--ext` matches case-insensitively; default aligned with the README.

### Fixed

- Lock leak when the PID file write failed after lock acquire.
- `parse_hierarchical_keyword` returning `['']` for empty input.
- StubAgent exposing `usage` as a callable instead of an attribute.
- Pydantic-AI deprecation: access `result.usage` as a property.
- EXIF orientation now honored; PIL file handles closed eagerly.
- Over-long keyword lists are truncated rather than failing validation.
- Cache and lock startup errors degrade to warnings instead of failing the run.
- Cache I/O errors are treated as warnings, not photo failures.
- Skip-list appender is now thread-safe under `--workers > 1`.
- Numeric env vars (`JPEG_QUALITY`, `TEMPERATURE`, etc.) parse safely with a warning instead of
  crashing.

### Security

- `--api-key` warns that CLI args are visible in process listings; prefer env vars
  (`OLLAMA_API_KEY`, `LM_STUDIO_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`).
- Lock file permissions tightened to `0o600`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-16

Initial release.

### Added

- `photo-tagger` CLI that asks a vision-language model to analyze each photo and writes
  Lightroom-compatible metadata (title, one-sentence description, and hierarchical keywords).
- RAW and standard image support: CR3, CR2, NEF, JPG, PNG, and more.
- XMP sidecars by default; `--embed-in-photo` writes metadata directly into the image instead.
- Keyword merging with existing metadata by default; `--overwrite-keywords` replaces.
  `--no-write-title` / `--no-write-description` skip those fields.
- `--no-backup-xmp` to skip the ExifTool `_original` snapshot.
- Provider support for Ollama and LM Studio via their OpenAI-compatible APIs. Selected with
  `--provider`; endpoint and credentials via `--url` / `--api-key` or env vars (`OLLAMA_BASE_URL`,
  `OLLAMA_API_KEY`, `LM_STUDIO_BASE_URL`, `LM_STUDIO_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`).
- Repeatable `-i/--input` accepting files and directories; `--ext` filters by extension,
  `-r/--recursive` walks subdirectories.
- Inference knobs: `-m/--model`, `--temperature`, `--max-tokens`, `--retries`, `--jpeg-dimensions`,
  `--jpeg-quality`. Each also has an env-var override (`MODEL_NAME`, `TEMPERATURE`, etc.).
- In-memory JPEG conversion to keep token usage low.
- Structured log files for debugging and auditing.
